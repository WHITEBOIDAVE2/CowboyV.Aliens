<p>
Cowboys in their homes, west of the Mississippi, are being invaded by aliens. There will be different types of enemies for the player to encounter and the goal is to make it past town to a horse (an ending cutscene will be shown). The protagonist of the story is Alex Navarro, attempting to escape alive. Inspired by the movie Cowboys vs. Indians, this spin-off has aliens with lasers. Aliens will seek Navarro so the player must shoot the aliens with their own blaster. In the beginning, alien UFOS ambush the player from the sky. At the height of the action, there will be a horde of aliens that come from the left and right side in which the player can only dodge the alien attacks. A boss is encountered at the very end of the game and if the player defeats the boss, the player wins the game.

<p>
The player controls the protagonist with the left and right arrow keys and shoots with the spacebar, gaining points for every alien shot. There will be some surprise aliens near the end of the level to keep the player on his/her toes. Different aliens will target the player and will not stop until the player shoots them (oriented towards level 1 and 2). As long as the player does not collide with the aliens 4 times, the game is not over. The player only has 4 lives and when the aliens damage the main character 4 times, the game will display a cutscene where the player can restart from the start. The captain of the aliens will face off the protagonist in the end, blocking the exit to the town (player must defeat captain). Finally, the score is totaled in the end with the player on a horse free from aliens.
